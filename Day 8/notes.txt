Day 8 : Consume Rest API in UI application (This could be done from MVC, Angular, React, Node,desktop application  etc..)

We will be doing this with MVC

MVC is an server side application development framework, 
.Net core supports makeing api calls in 2 ways

Desktop application - this are applications which does not know/understand Javasript

1. Client Side Calls - This is fastest, not safe and secure
	use this when your data/server applications are not working on confendential / sencetieve data like banking/hotel booking/ insurance/ etc..
	can be used for makeing calls to services like
	temperature 
	currency exchange
	get flight information (schedule)

	we use Fetch API, an api built into browser, fetch api is an W3C and ECMA standard
	(other api's can be used as well, like JQuery, axios etc..)

2. Server side calls : This is safest, a little bit slower than the above one, as it has to hop DNS
		this is more secured than the above one

		we use HttpClient to make calls

we will learn both of this 

	both the above API are Async 


----------------------------------------------
	Fetch api is a standard api, it supports async calls, returns a promise, thus a guranteed api
	this is supporting a try catch finally block


	then catch and finally

	fetch(url).then(incoming data type)	
		  .then(result) { javascript to display the result)
		  .catch(err) { javascript to display the error)
		  .finally() { ....}

----------------------------------------------------------------
1. create a new MVC application
2. in the controller, add a new ActionMethod - postData
3. Add a view based on above
