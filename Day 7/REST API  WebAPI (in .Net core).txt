REST API / WebAPI (in .Net core)

--This is all about data - it has no UI
--All the major applciation today (especially mobile apps) - they exchage data in JSON format, which is provided by REST          
  API - Service
--It is responsible to connect to datasource(Database,big data, file, network, application logs etc..) and perform CRUD operations
--All the Angular, React, Node applciation they are all based on javascript, which cannot connect to database, thuswe need 	a middle ware which can connect to backeend and provide data

First REST API / WebAPI

1. Create a database and add tables with data
	(we have used the same database as of ASP.net MVC and EF - shopping app, sql script is available in that folder)
2. Create a new WebAPI application (ASP.net webapi)
3. We need to install nuget packges for working with DB, we will use Entity framework core
4. Ready your connection string, we need this to execute EF core command from console
	"server=NIKHILPC\TRAINING_SERVER;database=shoppingDB;integrated security=true;trustservercertificate=true"

	tools -> Nuget package manager -> Package manager console 

5. right click controller folder - add controller - API - api controller with EF
	choose table name as model
	choose dbcontextfile as dbcontext
	press enter
6. it uses DI by default, we will remove the same 
	comment the constructor
	instantiate new object of DBContext class

7. repeat the same for all the tables (step 5 and 6)

8. build and run the application
